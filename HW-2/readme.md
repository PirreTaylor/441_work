## Homework 2

**Weekly progress:**
As this week's homework was light, I only needed to take one afternoon/evening to finish it.

**What did/did not work, frustrations, and time spent:**
My biggest challenge in this assignment was resolving errors in the console log. It took some experimenting and some research, but eventually, I learned that what I had been messing up on was that the console.log function in JavaScript doesn't accommodate for multiple lines or quotations under normal circumstances. After resolving that syntax error, the code worked fine, although I feel badly that I ended up putting such a long tirade of information into the log. In the future, I will have to learn how to better organize such information within it if it is possible.
