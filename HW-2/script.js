console.log("Three of my favorite restaurants are Murry's, the No-Sweat Cafe, and Chef Mai's. Helena is pretty limited on its food choices, though. Three of my favorite snack foods are Tim-Tams, Chessmen Cookies, and hummus. At least one of those snacks is healthy. Can tea count as a snack? Three of my favorite fruits/veggies are mangoes, cucumbers, and spinach. Mangoes are good for the digestive system.");
