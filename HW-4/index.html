        In this interactive role-playing experience, you will take on the persona
        of an intrepid Space Captain who is searching for the perfect gift for his
        boss' birthday. Going bravely where, well, frankly all species have gone before,
        you take to the neon-lit epicenter of commerce that is the Grand Galactic Mall.
        What perils and thrills lie in the twists and turns of this realm of intergalactic retail?
        One can only imagine.

          You have arrived at the Grand Galactic Mall. Where do you want to go
          first? You try to think about what your boss would like for his birthday.
          Does he like anything? You also notice that a gnawing hunger has taken hold since
          you got here. Looks like you need to eat! There is a food court ahead, as well as
          a holographic map showing the mall's catalogue of stores. Do you want to check the map first
          and form a plan of action, or do you feel that it is more important to get something to eat first?
