##Final Project Journal

*Here we are at the final stretch! There were a lot of things I wanted to do with this project that I had to cut short in the interest of time. One idea involved a puzzle with inputting a password to get into the cave. The biggest idea I had to scrap, though, were the HTML5 canvas elements I wanted to work in. Originally, the story's text was going to draw to a canvas with a unique fade-in effect. The idea behind this was that it would mimic the look of text scroll boxes in class role-playing video games. I wasn't able to figure this out in time, however, and eventually went with the substitute of having the text fade-in using jQuery effects. My hope is to keep working on this project even after class is over to eventually figure out how to work in the functions that I wanted to include, but couldn't. I know I still have a long way to go before I master coding, but hopefully this was just the first step into a greater journey.*
