## Homework 2

**Weekly progress:**
I have the problem of wanting to finish an assignment and learn a lesson all in one sitting, which probably isn't good. I got up early and finished the assignment all in one day. This probably will not be a wise option going forward, but it seems to be working for now. I will try to readjust my work schedule for the next assignment.
**What did/did not work, frustrations, and time spent:**
As mentioned before, I finished the assignment over the course of one day. I did not encounter any problems this week, as it centered more on just setting up the page in html and learning how to print to the DOM, but I am worried that I might have either missed something by accident or am going to struggle with building the rest of the pages next week. It is likely that I am just over-thinking things, though.
