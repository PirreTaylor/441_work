## Homework 5

**Weekly Progress**
Because I spent most of the week catching up on the past assignment, it wasn't until Friday and Saturday that I was able to tackle
the current assignment. Thankfully, I was able to figure both assignments out, bringing me back up to speed with the course.
**What did/did not work, frustrations, and time spent:**
One of the biggest challenges this week has been making sure that the additional cells pull in the three other images
for the game. Although following along with the video lectures and working off of the weekly example helped exponentially,
I still keep running into an issue in the script where it seems to not want to pull in the other images as variables, despite them being defined the actualImagePath variable. I have the suspicion that it has to do with one of the loops or variable. This error will hopefully be corrected in time for the continuation of the assignment next week.

On a side note, I decided to leave the comments in from the examples should I need to look back at this assignment for future
reference to remember what to do. I hope that is alright.
