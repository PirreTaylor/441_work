## Homework 1

**Weekly progress:**
---
I spent early half of the week catching up with course's video meetings and learning what they course's standards were. I also spent time re-acquainting myself with how GitHub and Atom worked.
The later part of the week was spent reviewing HTML and CSS notes I had taken last year in my Intro to Web Development class. Finally, on the last day, I spent time finishing the code on my project, working through as many roadblocks as possible, and gradually uploading it to GitHub.

**What did/did not work, frustrations, and time spent:**
---
While I was, for the most part, able to get back into the flow of coding, I could not resolve on issue involving the way the header text displayed alongside the hero image. The text would always be surrounded in a field of the page's background color, thus blotting out the page's hero image. In addition to this, I could not get the text in this portion to align to the center. In terms of time invested, I spent most of my time in this assignment trying to fix how the upper image displayed, with the language studied in this portion being mostly a review of what I had learned in the past, but had forgotten. Writing the actual page took little time, but resolving its errors and reviewing what I had learned took me several hours.
