    <h2>Bio</h2>
   <p>
     Taylor Pirre is a Senior-year Media Arts student attending University of Montana
     online from Helena, Montana. Currently slated to graduate this spring, she
     hopes that she will be able to combine her passion for traditional art and
     technology into a worthwhile career.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    My favorite hobbies include creating art and playing video games. Because of this,
    it is my hope to one day combine my passion for creating with interactive media
    by developing my own virtual experiences. There is so much that can be expressed
    and conveyed through interactive media as an art form while, at the same time, inviting others
    to be a part of the artistic experience by allowing them to engage with the work.
