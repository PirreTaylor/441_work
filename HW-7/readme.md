## Homework 7

**Weekly Progress**
Because of the workload of my other classes, it wasn't until Saturday that I was able to start
learning the materials for week 7. The weekend ended up being my two days to learn the material,
while Monday was devoted to finishing the actual work.
**What did/did not work, frustrations, and time spent:**
This week, I learned that it is more important to devote time to practicing rather than outright studying terms.
While I thought I had a good grasp of object and class-based programming in theory, putting it into
practice ended up being a completely different ballgame. I am still unsure how to make it so that my image constructors will
inject into the div they are supposed to fill alongside their corresponding text. I need to stop being stubborn and ask for help more often. I waste too much time trying to figure things out the hard way.
